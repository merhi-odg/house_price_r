# house_price_r
A sample data science project that uses a Linear Regression model built in R to predict house price from the Ames Housing Data dataset. Specifically, this example is used to demonstrate the creating of ModelOp Center(MOC)-compliant code.

## Assets:
- `house_price.R` is the R code that houses the MOC-compliant code to predict and get metrics on data.
- `trained_model.RData` is the trained model artifact that is loaded upon prediction. In our case, the artifact is a workflow built on top of a recipe that includes a few data cleaning steps and a call to a linear regression model.
- The datasets used for **scoring** are `baseline.json` and `sample.json`. These datasets represent raw data that would first be run into a batch scoring job. A sample of the outcome to the scoring job is provided in the `output_action_sample.json` file.
- The datasets for **metrics** are `baseline_scored.json` and `sample_scored.json`. These datasets represent data that has appended the predictions from a scoring job. The columns are renamed to be compliant with MOC; `Sale_Price` is renamed to `ground_truth` and the prediction column is named `prediction`.

## Directions:
1. For a **scoring** job, use the `baseline.json` or the `sample.json` files. The output is a JSON string object that has the orignal `Sale_Price` and `prediction` for each input row.
2. For a **metrics** job, use the `baseline_scored.json` or the `sample_scored.json` files. THe output is a list of the relevant metrics (RMSE, R2, MAE) for the regression model.

The input data to the **scoring** job is `sample.json`, which is a JSONS file (one-line JSON records). Here is the first record:

The input data to the **metrics** job is `sample_scored.json`, which is a JSONS file (one-line JSON records). Here is the first record:
